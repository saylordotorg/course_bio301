title: "BIO301: Cell Biology"
course_description: "A detailed exploration of the cell and its structures, including molecular compounds, structural features, and organelles including the nucleus, cytoskeleton, and extracellular matrix. Particular emphasis on transport mechanisms and membrane trafficking, cellular signaling, the cell cycle including mitosis and meiosis, and gene expression."

**Unit 6: The Cell Nucleus and Gene Expression** <span id="6"></span> 
*As you learned in BIO101, the cell nucleus is the storage area for all
genetic material and constantly full of activity. The nucleus, in fact,
contains not only DNA, but RNA and protein as well. This unit will take
a detailed look at chromosomes, the cell nucleus, gene expression, and
expression regulation. When we refer to expression regulation, we are
talking about the fact that not all genes are expressed in the cell at
the same time. After all, though a liver cell and a nerve cell have the
same genome (and thus the same DNA), they look and act completely
differently. How does this happen? The answer is regulated gene
expression!*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 21.5 hours.

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, you will be able to
-   distinguish between euchromatin and heterochromatin in terms of
    which is the active form of genes;
-   identify the components of the nuclear envelope and their functions;
-   describe the roles of enhancers and repressors in gene expression;
    and
-   describe gene regulation (pre- and post-transcription).
