**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, you will be able to
-   identify the functions of major organic molecules;
-   understand hydrophilic and hydrophobic bonds and their respective
    roles in cells (particularly in terms of cell-membrane structure);
-   understand the four levels of protein structures and be able to
    identify which structure is referred to in a given example; and
-   understand the relationship between free energy and the direction of
    a reaction.
