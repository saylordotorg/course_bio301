**Unit 8: Meiosis** <span id="8"></span> 
*Meiosis, the other form of cell division, is the process by which one
cell becomes four genetically unique cells. This process is essential to
reproduction and the creation of unique offspring, which ultimately adds
diversity to life. Meiosis is the reason you look similar to (but not
exactly like) your parents. As in mitosis, meiosis is composed of four
phases. However, meiosis takes place in two stages, meiosis I and II.
Most importantly, there is period of genetic recombination in meiosis
during which the maternal and paternal DNA mix and result in the
development of unique genomes. You should also note that, unlike
mitosis, meiosis results in haploid cells and only takes place in two
types of cells: sperm and oocyte cells.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 7.5 hours.

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, you will be able to
-   identify what major cellular events occur at each phase of the
    meiotic cell cycle;
-   distinguish between mitosis and meiosis in terms of both specific
    cellular events and the types of cells resulting from the process;
    and
-   describe the differences between oocyte formation and sperm
    formation.
