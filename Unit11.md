**Unit 11: Specialized Organelle Functions** <span id="11"></span> 
*This unit will discuss the special functions of certain cell
organelles. You might think of organelles as specialized organs that
perform vital tasks such as digestion, detoxification, and energy
production. Detoxification plays more of a role in a liver cell, whereas
digestion is more important in a stomach cell, and energy production is
more important in a muscle cell. Thus, although all cells have the same
kinds of organelles, the relative abundance of each type is different
based on the type of cell you are studying.*

**Unit 11 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 21 hours.

**11.3.2 Carbohydrate Metabolism and the Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum**
<span id="11.3.2"></span> 
*One of the common functions of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum,
particularly in liver hepatocytes, kidney cells, and intestinal cells,
is the enzymatic breakdown of glycogen to form glucose. A major role of
these organs is to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. When needed by
the body, glycogen is broken down into individual glucose molecules. The
glucose is converted to glucose-1-phosophate and then
glucose-6-phosphate. Since cell membranes are typically impermeable to
phosphorylated sugars, the glucose-6-phosphate must be converted to
glucose so that it can leave the cell and enter the bloodstream for
distribution throughout the body. Glucose-6-phosphatase, an enzyme bound
to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membrane, removes the phosphate
group from glucose-6-phosphate; the glucose is then transported out of
the cell by a transport molecule within the cell membrane.*
