**Unit 9: The Cell Cycle** <span id="9"></span> 
*Both meiosis and mitosis represent one phase of the cell cycle, which
is an ordered set of events that a cell undergoes in preparation for
division. The cell cycle we talk about usually refers to the mitotic
cell cycle, but there is also a meiotic cell cycle. The cell cycle
consists of several distinct phases, such as doubling of the genome,
growing in size, etc. In addition, the cell cycle has many restriction
points that act like roadblocks, preventing the cell from dividing
before it is ready to do so.These restriction points ensure the
integrity of the cell. Any mutation that results in cell division
without the control of the checkpoints will likely result in cancer.*

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, you will be able to
-   describe what cellular events (or lack of events) occur during each
    phase of the cell cycle;
-   identify in what phase of the cycle specific types of cells are
    found;
-   describe the roles of cyclin and CDKs in regulating the cell cycle;
    and
-   describe the cyclin/CDK pathway and what molecules/intracellular
    events are involved in different aspects of cell-cycle regulation.

**9.4.4 Cyclin Degradation** <span id="9.4.4"></span> 
*This subunit is covered by the reading and video assigned beneath
subunit 9.4. Focus on the subsection “MPF: A Dimer of Cdc2 and
Cyclin” and associated figure (Figure 14.14). Cyclin degradation is
crucial to moving forward with the cell cycle. Without degradation,
there would be too many active CDKs, and the resulting mix would greatly
confuse a cell in terms of whether it should proceed or stop. Specific
cancers mutate certain CDKs and push the cell to constantly divide.*
