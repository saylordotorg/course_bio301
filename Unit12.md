**Unit 12: Apoptosis** <span id="12"></span> 
*Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an orderly series of events
that lead to the death of a cell in multicellular organisms. This is a
normal process that balances with cell division and is controlled by a
variety of internal and external signals. Apoptosis is important during
developmental processes in that it eliminates unwanted cells from a
variety of tissues.*

**Unit 12 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 6 hours.

**Unit12 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, you will be able to
-   define apoptosis;
-   distinguish between normal cells and apoptotic cells; and
-   distinguish between intrinsic pathway vs. the extrinsic pathway for
    apoptosis.
