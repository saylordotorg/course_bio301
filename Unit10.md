**Unit 10: Cellular Transport** <span id="10"></span> 
*Just as your body has a circulatory system that moves nutrients and
waste, every cell in your body has a vast network system that carries
things from one place to another. In unit 5, you learned about the units
that make up this transport network. You will now learn about the
signals and roadmaps that direct traffic in that network. Though there
are many different types of transport, the most important ones export
gene products from the nucleus to their destined locations. As you will
see, the gene products themselves include specific sequences that define
their destination.*  
  
 *You will also learn that cells have the ability to secrete or intake
vesicles (membrane-enclosed spaces), which also require specific
transport mechanisms. This unit will go over a few of the major
mechanisms.*

**Unit 10 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 16 hours.
