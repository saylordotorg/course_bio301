**Unit 2: The Cell Membrane** <span id="2"></span> 
*Organisms must be able to maintain homeostasis, or a constant internal
environment, in order to survive. Cells achieve homeostasis by creating
a barrier to the outside world—a cell membrane—that enables them to
protect their internal environment from external forces. In fact, cells
die when the cell membrane’s integrity is destroyed or compromised. In
this unit, you will learn about the membrane and its properties. You
will discover that the cell membrane serves as much more than just a
wall—it also transports nutrients, exports waste, carries signals, and
much more.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 13 hours.

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, you will be able to  
-   identify the components of membranes;
-   describe how these components affect membrane properties;
-   identify types of membrane transport (specific pumps and channels);
    and
-   describe the role of various molecules and ions (e.g. sodium,
    calcium) in this transport.

resistant to many of the antibiotics that doctors give to patients with
infections. Super germs are antibiotic-resistant, because they have
special ABC transporters that are designed to pump the drug out of the
bacteria, reducing or even negating its effects.*
