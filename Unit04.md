**Unit 4: The Plant Cell Wall and the Extracellular Matrix (ECM)** <span
id="4"></span> 
*Different types of cells produce and secrete different molecules that
can alter their external environment. An environment that has been
altered in this way in the plant cell is the plant cell wall. It
determines the cell shape and prevents cells from bursting because of
osmotic pressure. An environment that has been altered in this way in
animal cells is known as the extracellular matrix (ECM). The matrix’s
main purpose is to form an ordered network for physical support, but it
also plays a role in signaling, immunity, and wound healing. There are
five main classes of ECM molecules; all ECMs are composed of some
combination of these five types.*

**4.6.1 Loose Connective Tissue (LCT)** <span id="4.6.1"></span> 
*This subunit is covered by the reading and video assigned beneath
subunit 4.1. Focus on the “The Extracellular Matrix” section. There are
substantial differences between loose and dense connective tissue. Dense
tissue is largely composed of collagen (type I), while loose connective
tissue has as equal amounts of elastic fibers and collagen. DCT makes up
ligaments and tendons, while LCT surrounds nearly every internal organ
in the body.*

**4.6.2 Dense Connective Tissue (DCT)** <span id="4.6.2"></span> 
*Dense connective tissue consists of extracellular matrix in which
fibers and cells are embedded. Type I collagen is the predominant
component of the fibers. There are considerably few cells in this
tissue. Dense connective tissue is quite strong.*  
    
 *There are two types of dense connective tissue based on
the arrangement of fibers. In dense regular connective tissue, the
fibers are in a common direction or parallel to one another. In rows
between the fibers are fibroblasts, cells that produce the collagen and
extracellular matrix. Dense regular connective tissue withstands pulling
along the axis of the fibers and is found in tendons that connect muscle
to bone and ligaments that connect bone to bone. Dense irregular
connective tissue contains type I collagen fibers in bundles without any
specific orientation. This tissue type is found in the body where
pulling forces are exerted in various directions. This tissue often
occurs in sheets, such as in the dermis of the skin or the pericardium
of the heart.*
