**Unit 7: Mitosis and Cytokinesis** <span id="7"></span> 
*Every cell in your body has the capacity to divide and make new cells.
Mitosis is the process by which one cell turns into two identical cells.
Because of mitosis, most cells in your body don’t live past a few
months. In other words, despite your chronological age, your body is
really just a few months old!*  
  
 *Mitosis is divided into four phases. This unit will carefully explore
each phase, ending with cytokinesis, whereby the cell membrane will
pinch itself off and split in half in order to produce two separate
cells.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 7.5 hours.

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, you will be able to
-   identify what major cellular events occur at each phase of the
    mitotic cell cycle and during cytokinesis;
-   distinguish between open and closed mitosis; and
-   describe how to visually identify the phases of the mitotic cycle.
