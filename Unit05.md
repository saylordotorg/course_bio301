**Unit 5: The Cytoskeleton** <span id="5"></span> 
*The cytoskeleton, as the name suggests, provides the physical support
for the interior of the cell. You might think of it as cellular
skeleton. There are three main types of support molecules: actin,
tubulin, and intermediate filaments. All the muscles fibers in your body
are mainly composed of these support molecules. These molecules also
build an internal highway within the cell, upon which almost everything
is transported. This unit will explore all three molecules in detail and
provide some important examples of what they combine to create.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 21 hours.

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   describe the different roles of actin, tubulin, and intermediate
    filaments;
-   describe the properties and functions of actin, tubulin, and
    intermediate filaments;
-   describe the means through which cytoskeletal molecules are formed;
    and
-   determine which cytoskeletal molecule or process has been disrupted
    when given an example of a particular cellular problem or lack of
    function.
